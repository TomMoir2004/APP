    <h2><b>Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn’t be
        available if things go wrong.</b></h2>
    <p>Many people assume agoraphobia is simply a fear of open spaces, but it's actually a more complex condition.</p>
    <p>Someone with agoraphobia may be scared of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Travelling on public transport</li>
      <li>Visiting a shopping centre</li>
      <li>Leaving home</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If someone with agoraphobia finds themselves in a stressful situation, they may experience symptoms of a panic
      attack such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rapid heartbeat</li>
      <li>Rapid breathing (hyperventilating)</li>
      <li>Feeling hot and sweaty</li>
      <li>Feeling sick</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They'll avoid situations that cause anxiety and may only leave the house with a friend or partner. They'll order
      groceries online rather than going to the supermarket. This change in behaviour is known as avoidance.</p>

    <p><b>What causes agoraphobia?</b></p>
    <p>Agoraphobia can develop as a complication of panic disorder, an anxiety disorder involving panic attacks. It can
      arise from associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occurred and then avoiding them.</p>
    <p>Not all people with agoraphobia have a history of panic attacks. In these cases, their fear may be related to
      crime, terrorism, illness, or being in an accident.</p>

    <p><b>Diagnosing agoraphobia</b></p>
    <p>Speak to your GP if you think you may be affected by agoraphobia. It should be possible to arrange a telephone
      consultation if you're not ready to visit in person.</p>
    <p>Your GP will ask you to describe your symptoms, how often they occur, and in what situations. Be honest about how
      your symptoms affect your life.</p>
    <p>They may ask questions like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you find leaving the house stressful?</li>
      <li>Are there certain places or situations you avoid?</li>
      <li>Do you rely on others to shop or help with tasks outside the home?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It can be difficult to talk about your feelings, but your GP needs details to diagnose and recommend appropriate
      treatment.</p>

    <p><b>Treating agoraphobia</b></p>
    <p>Common treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), self-help techniques, and medication if necessary.
      Support from mental health services can also help.</p>
