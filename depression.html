        <strong>Depression</strong> is a low mood that lasts for weeks or months and affects your daily life.
        <br /><br />
        Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months. It is a genuine illness with real symptoms — not something you can just "snap out of."
        <br /><br />
        <strong>How to tell if you have depression:</strong> Symptoms range from lasting feelings of unhappiness, losing interest in things you used to enjoy, to physical signs like fatigue and sleep issues. Depression can be mild to severe and may lead to suicidal thoughts in extreme cases.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>When to see a doctor:</strong> Seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. The sooner you seek help, the sooner recovery can begin.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>What causes depression?</strong> Triggers may include life events, genetics, personality traits, or even seemingly no reason. Family history can play a role.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Treating depression:</strong> Treatment can include lifestyle changes, therapy, and medication. Mild cases may be managed through exercise and self-help, while severe cases might require specialist care.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Living with depression:</strong> Healthy lifestyle changes, reading self-help books, and support groups can help. Understanding triggers and sharing experiences is key.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Symptoms of depression:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Psychological:</em> Low mood, hopelessness, guilt, irritability, suicidal thoughts</li>
          <li><em>Physical:</em> Fatigue, appetite change, pain, sleep disturbance</li>
          <li><em>Social:</em> Withdrawing from friends, neglecting hobbies, family conflicts</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Severity:</strong> Depression may range from mild to severe and can include psychosis in extreme cases. Often it’s a friend or loved one who notices first.

        <br /><br />
        <strong>Grief vs. Depression:</strong> While grief and depression share symptoms, grief typically eases over time. Depression is a medical condition and may require treatment.

        <br /><br />
        <strong>Types of depression:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Postnatal Depression</li>
          <li>Bipolar Disorder</li>
          <li>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</li>
          <li>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Common Triggers:</strong> Stressful life events, personality, family history, pregnancy, menopause, loneliness, substance misuse, and illness.

        <br /><br />
        <strong>Important:</strong> If symptoms last for most of the day, every day, for over two weeks — see a doctor.
